# ApocaplyseVR
VR Zombie Survival Game and with a little bit twist of learning experience. Shooting game but educational as well where players will collect bonus item drops which will lead to new items and rare bonus drops to survive next round else difficulty is raised to 20% which will mostly impossible to survive.
Need assitance in Shooting configuration as I am not able to shoot the zombie even though I have called the bullet prefab rest details are mentioned in the "PLAYERSCRIPT".
